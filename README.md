# Regression-Study-Concrete
This Regression Case Study Report uses Python statistical modelling and applies multiple linear regression techniques. The aim of this case was to predict concrete compressive strength based on age and ingredients, which had been compiled into a dataset sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength (Yeh, 2007).

## Prerequisites
- Clone this remote repository https://github.com/kimt12531/Regression-Study-Concrete.git

The report may be viewed through opening `Concrete_Regression_Study.html` in your web browser. Markdown and Python code and output should be visible. You may also view it through `Visual Studio Code` or `Jupyter Notebook`.

## Viewing the Report with VS Code
Please Note: Running Python code in a .ipynb file in VS Code may throw errors due to module imports. If that occurs, restore changes via `git restore` or Source Control (Ctrl + Shift + G).

- Please ensure that you have `Python` installed local machine
    - `python3 --version` in terminal to check
- Please ensure that you have the VS Code extention, `Jupyter`
- Open this project in VS Code
- Please ensure that there are `Concrete_Regression_Study.ipynb` and `Concrete_Data.csv` in the same directory
- Open `Concrete_Regression_Study.ipynb` as a file in VS Code
    - Markdown and Python code and output should be visible
    
## Viewing the Report with Anaconda Jupyter Notebook
- Launch Jupyter Notebook
- Upload `Concrete_Regression_Study.ipynb` and `Concrete_Data.csv` in the same folder
- Open `Concrete_Regression_Study.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
    - Markdown and Python code and output should be visible
    - If not, ensure that it is Running. Otherwise, select Kernel > Restart & Run All
